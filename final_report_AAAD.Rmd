## Motivation

We are interested in how environmental determinants of health, especially the short term effects of air quality measures, affect acute health outcomes such as asthma and cardiovascular disease hospitalizations. This also helps us understand the burden of acute health outcomes especially given our changing climate. We hope our results will help illustrate potential health disparities within and across New York State and thus areas requiring future research.
