## Motivation

Unlike many factors we can control in determining our health, outdoor air quality is almost impossible to alter given its ubiquitous nature. We are interested in how environmental determinants of health, especially the short term effects of air quality measures, affect acute health outcomes. This also helps us understand the burden of acute health outcomes especially given our changing climate, and the potential impact of worsening air quality in both urban areas and rural areas. 

Our goal is to illustrate potential health disparities across New York State, the trends in the relationship between air quality and acute health outcomes, and areas (geographically and scientifically) requiring future research.
