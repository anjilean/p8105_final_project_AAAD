Motivation
----------

Unlike many factors we can control in determining our health, outdoor air quality is almost impossible to alter given its ubiquitous nature. We are interested in how environmental determinants of health, especially the short term effects of air quality measures, affect acute health outcomes. This also helps us understand the burden of acute health outcomes especially given our changing climate, and the potential impact of worsening air quality in both urban areas and rural areas.

Our goal is to illustrate potential health disparities across New York State, the trends in the relationship between air quality and acute health outcomes, and areas (geographically and scientifically) requiring future research.

**What Amelia wrote:**

Ambient (outdoor) air pollution is a widespread public health issue because it affects everyone. Across the globe, it accounts for significant morbidity and, to a lesser degree, mortality. Indoor air pollution is also an important exposure pathway particularly for women and children who live in households that burn solid fuel for cooking and heating. For this project, we focused on ambient air quality because there is more available data and because indoor air pollution is less widespread in the United States and New York State than in other places around the world.

When someone breathes, they are exposed not to a single compound in isolation but rather to a mixture of compounds. Two compounds that are known to confer toxicity are ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Ozone is a fat soluble chemical than can bypass absorption in the upper respiratory system and penetrate down into the alveoli. PM2.5 is a tiny particle that, due to it's size, can also travel deep into the alveoli. Both PM2.5 and ozone can have harmful local effects in the respiratory system and, because of their ability to cross from the lung into the bloodstream, can have harmful distal effects throughout the cardiovascular system.

We were interested in how air pollution in New York State, including specific compounds like PM2.5 and ozone, may lead to the acute exacerbation of chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases and asthma as well as acute cardiovascular symptoms. It is critical to note that poor communities are more susceptible to the potential life-threatening, acute effects of air pollution because they are more likely to have chronic diseases like asthma and heart disease and are more likely to live in more highly contaminated neighborhoods.

Related work
------------

*Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, or something we discussed in class.*

Previous classwork utilizing NOAA data inspired us to explore other kinds of environmental dat a.
We were also influenced by air pollution researchers at Columbia University like Dr. Frederica Perera, Dr. Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou, and others at the Center for Children's Environmental Health.

Initial questions
-----------------

*What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?*

Data
----

*Source, scraping method, cleaning, etc - Anjile*

Acknowledge multiple ways of measuring things - days, person-days, ug/m3 etc. Justify! - Ozone was not used bc not consistently measured across counties.

Exploratory analysis
--------------------

*Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory statistical analyses. Justify the steps you took, and show any major changes to your ideas.* - Ashley, Div

Additional analysis
-------------------

*If you undertake formal statistical analyses, describe these in detail.* - Model building - Looked at associations, trends

Discussion
----------

*What were your findings? Are they what you expect? What insights into the data can you make?*

Asthma is chronic disease so asthma emergency room visit rates reflect asthma exacerbation incidents. In contrast, cardiovascular hospitalization rates do not differentiate between a one-time acute episode like a stroke or an exacerbation of an underlying cardiovascular condition like high blood pressure or arrhythmia.

Limitation - So many things in air, mixtures, hard to get data on/complicated to analyze. Include in future models.
