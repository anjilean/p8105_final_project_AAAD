Name:O3-Attributable Asthma Hospitalizations ,Measure:Rate- Children 0 to 17 Yrs Old (per 100000 children),How Calculated:Estimate is based on the number of hospitalizations for urgent asthma associated with the difference in air quality for indicator years relative to natural background (modeled air quality levels under no man made air pollution emissions).  Estimate is calculated using the acute risk of hospitalization for urgent asthma from the Silverman et al 2010 study conducted on NYC residents.
